    * How to switch the the working repositry(from one branch toanotehr)
     - git checkout branchName
     - git checkout  -b branchname - create new branch and change to that branch 
   * To delete a branch in a Git repository, you can use the following command:

     git branch -d branch_name
     Replace branch_name with the name of the branch you want to delete.

     If the branch has not been merged into other branches, you might need to use the -D option instead of -d:

    git branch -D branch_name
    The -d option stands for delete, and it's a safer option because it prevents you from accidentally deleting branches that haven't been merged yet.
    The -D option, on the other hand, forces the deletion regardless of whether the branch has been merged or not. Use it with caution.
